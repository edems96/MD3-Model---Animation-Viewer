# MD3 Model & Animation Viewer
This program can open **[.md3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD3_(file_format))** model *(from [Quake 3 Arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena))* files with **.cfg** animations.
It using **SDL2** and **OpenGL** for rendering and drawing.

This is my big homework for my university.
